# Stock-Ananlysis
# Refactoring exercise using VBA  
#
Overview  
   We have previously ran this subroutine and it was successful. We are now refactoring the code to see if we can have it run faster and more efficiently.
   
 Results
   The original version of the code ran in just over .27 seconds. The refactored version ran in just over .07 seconds. The refactored code was substantially
   faster, running approximately 75% faster. We were only analyising 12 stocks in our example. If the the analysis was expanded to include all US stocks that
   would be over 3500 tickers. The efficentcy of the refactored code would lead to substantial time savings over that many stocks.
   
Summary
   The advantages of refactoring code are that if you can get it to run faster then that frees up resources to run more jobs. Corporate resources are valuable
   and time savings like this across an organization add up and are meaningful.
   The disadvantanges of refactoring are that it does not always result in meaningful improvemnts in performance. Sometimes it is not possible to have code run
   any more efficiently.
